In this Project, I have Created a Simple Interest Calculator
which will take Value of Priciple Amount, Interest Rate & Time to pay off the Simple Interest.
After,Calculating the Interest it will verify whether the Value is
ODD or EVEN.
After Which it will convert the Interest from Inr to Usd[Acc. to current Exchange Rates].
This Project was made by Me, 
on Java using IntelliG IDE and Java 18.0.2 JDK .
